# Uber Surge Pricing
ProcessBook_v4.ipynb is the process book that we are turning in.
output3.csv is the file that has the queried data saved into it.
prediction.py is not to be ran on from the repository, but instead this is the python script that we are running
	on an AWS machine to make the "app" portion of the website work. Thought it would be interesting to include
	just for reference

non-standard Python libraries used: plotly and flask.

plotly uses an api key which is included in the header. When you are running the script, this should work, you can only
	make so many requests in an hour,however, so the code may break.

Note: A plotly account with a unique user ID and API key is needed to see the graphs. Read the note in the Process Book in
	order to view some of the graphs in the process book, they do not show up on the GitHub Website version of the Process Book.

	**USE CHROME to view website. It works well in chrome, however, other websites are not optimized and the app may not work.
	**The website code (very extensive) is on dilliontiner's respository CS109Site (url: https://github.com/dillontiner/CS109Site)
